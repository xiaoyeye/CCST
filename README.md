# CCSTï¼šCell clustering for spatial transcriptomics data with graph neural network 

Taking advantages of two recent technical development, spatial transcriptomics and graph neural network, we  thus introduce CCST, Cell Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics data with graph neural network, an unsupervised cell clustering method based on graph convolutional network to improve ab initio cell clustering and discovering of novel sub cell types based on curated cell category annotation. CCST is a general framework for dealing with various kinds of spatially resolved transcriptomics.

1.2 Required packages in python: 

numpy==1.19.2

pandas==1.2.3

sklearn==0.24.1

matplotlib==3.3.4

scipy==1.7.0

pytorch== 1.7.1

torch_geometric==1.6.3

torch_sparse==0.6.8

torch_scatter==2.0.5

# 2. Intructions of usage: demo code is tested on MERFISH.

2.1 Raw data is put in the folder "merfish". Need to be extracted firstly.

2.2 Run 'data_generation_merfish.py' to preprocess the raw data. The pocessed data will be save in folder "generated_data".

2.3 Run 'CCST_merfish.py' for node clustering and differential expressed gene extracting. 

2.4 The trained model, embedding data and analysis results will be saved in folder "model", "embedding_data" and "results_CCST" by defult.

2.5 Run Time to use for training and clustering: 284 seconds on GPU RTX 3090. GPU Memory usage: 1635MiB
